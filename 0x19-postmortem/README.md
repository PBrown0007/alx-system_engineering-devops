Postmortem: The Great "404-pocalypse" of March 2025
Issue Summary
Duration: March 1, 2025, 14:00 - 17:30 PST (3.5 hours of chaos)


Impact: Our e-commerce platform, Shop-o-Tron 3000, went full ghost mode 75% of users faced sluggish page loads or a soul-crushing "404: Store Not Found" error. Customers couldn’t shop, carts were abandoned, and the only thing thriving was the complaint inbox.


Root Cause: A misconfigured Nginx reverse proxy decided it was time to play "hide the backend servers" after a botched deployment. Oops.
Timeline
14:00 PST - Issue detected when monitoring screamed louder than a toddler on a sugar high: "Backend latency spiked to 10 seconds!"
14:05 PST - A heroic engineer noticed the spike while sipping coffee; customer support also reported a flood of “Where’s my stuff?” emails.
14:15 PST - Team investigated the API servers, assuming a database meltdown spoiler: it was fine.
14:45 PST - Misleading detour: spent 30 minutes debugging a perfectly innocent load balancer. RIP time.
15:30 PST - Escalated to the DevOps crew after realizing Nginx was the real villain.
16:45 PST - Found the typo in the Nginx config file; rolled back the deployment like it was a bad movie sequel.
17:30 PST - Services restored, users shopping again, world peace achieved (sort of).
Root Cause and Resolution
Cause: During a routine deployment, a sleepy engineer (hi, me) fat-fingered an Nginx config update, pointing the proxy to a nonexistent backend (app_server_9000 instead of app_server_8000). Nginx, ever the obedient chaos agent, happily 404’d most requests while the real servers twiddled their thumbs. Logs showed a tragic tale of “connection refused” errors.


Resolution: We reverted to the last known good config via a git rollback, restarted Nginx with systemctl restart nginx, and watched the green lights flicker back on. A quick test order for "Glow-in-the-Dark Socks" confirmed victory.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements: Better deployment checks, more coffee for engineers, and a stern talk with Nginx about its life choices.


TODO:
Patch Nginx config validation add a pre-deploy syntax check (nginx -t).
Automate backend endpoint testing post-deploy with a script (e.g., curl -I http://backend:8000/health).
Add monitoring for proxy-to-backend latency (Prometheus metric: nginx_backend_response_time).
Enforce peer review for all config changes because two sleepy eyes are better than one.
Schedule a “How Not to Break Everything” workshop for the team.

Why You Should Care
Ever wonder what happens when a typo takes down a store faster than a Black Friday stampede? Stick around for the diagram below Nginx’s mischief mapped out in glorious technicolor. Plus, we promise no more "404-pocalypses" (fingers crossed).

ADME: The Great "404-pocalypse" of March 2025

## Project Overview
This project documents the postmortem of a critical outage on our e-commerce platform, **Shop-o-Tron 3000**, where 75% of users faced sluggish performance and persistent "404: Store Not Found" errors. The incident was caused by a misconfigured Nginx reverse proxy during deployment, resulting in a widespread service disruption.

## Issue Summary
**Duration:** March 1, 2025, 14:00 - 17:30 PST (3.5 hours of chaos)  
**Impact:** Customers were unable to browse or complete purchases, leading to a sharp rise in cart abandonment and an overwhelmed support team.  
**Root Cause:** A deployment error introduced a misconfigured Nginx reverse proxy, which mistakenly routed traffic to a non-existent backend server.

---

# Timeline
- **14:00 PST:** Monitoring detects backend latency spike; alert triggered.
- **14:05 PST:** Engineer notices the issue, and support receives a flood of user complaints.
- **14:15 PST:** Investigation focuses on database health, but no anomalies found.
- **14:45 PST:** Load balancer debugging leads to a dead end.
- **15:30 PST:** DevOps team takes over and reviews Nginx configurations.
- **16:45 PST:** The typo in the Nginx config is identified and fixed.
- **17:30 PST:** Services restored, and normal operations resume.

---

## Root Cause & Resolution
### Root Cause
During a routine deployment, an incorrect Nginx configuration pointed the reverse proxy to `app_server_9000` instead of `app_server_8000`, effectively cutting off access to the backend servers. The result was a flood of "404 Not Found" errors across the site.

### Resolution
- Reverted to the last known working Nginx configuration.
- Restarted Nginx (`systemctl restart nginx`) to apply the corrected settings.
- Verified fix with test transactions to confirm full functionality.

---

## Corrective Actions & Preventative Measures
### What Went Wrong
- No automated validation of Nginx configurations pre-deployment.
- Debugging efforts wasted time on unrelated components.

### How We're Fixing It
- [ ] Implement a syntax check for Nginx configs before deployment (`nginx -t`).
- [ ] Automate backend health checks with a script (`curl -I http://backend:8000/health`).
- [ ] Enhance monitoring for proxy-to-backend latency (Prometheus metric: `nginx_backend_response_time`).
- [ ] Require peer review for all configuration changes.
- [ ] Conduct a team workshop: "How Not to Break Everything."

---

## Why This Matters
This incident serves as a reminder that even a small typo can cause major outages. The goal is to ensure this kind of failure never happens again through better validation, automation, and team collaboration.
